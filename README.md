Project Title: T20 World Cup Cricket Stats Super Analyzer - With Cool Pictures! 🤩

Description:

"Hey cricket superstars! 🌟 Want to be a cricket whiz? This project is like having your own cricket lab, where you can explore and discover amazing things about the T20 World Cup! It's super fun and easy to use!

What this code does (but even simpler):

Makes Up Cricket Matches! 🏏 We create our own pretend cricket games, just like the real T20 World Cup! We invent teams, scores, and even who wins! It's like playing cricket in your imagination!

Organizes Everything! 📊 We put all the match info into neat tables, like a digital cricket notebook! This way, we can easily see who won, how many runs were scored, and who the best players were!

Calculates Super Stats! 🤯 We figure out all sorts of cool cricket numbers, like:

Which teams are the best at winning!
Who the top batsmen and bowlers are!
How teams score in different parts of the game (like the powerplay and the last overs)!
If winning the toss helps you win the match!
How the scores have changed over different World Cups!
Draws Awesome Pictures! 🎨 We turn all those numbers into colorful charts and graphs! You can see who the best players and teams are, and compare them all in cool picture form!

Tries to Guess the Winners! 🔮 The most exciting part is that our code tries to predict who will win a match, based on past results! It's like having a cricket fortune-telling machine!

Why this is super cool:

You can learn tons of fun cricket facts!
You can see who the cricket heroes are!
You can even try to predict the future of cricket!
